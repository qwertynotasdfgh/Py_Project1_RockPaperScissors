Simple rock paper scissors game.
It asks the player if they would or would not like to play and then based on that it will begin the game or exit, the game is first to three and it keeps track and lets the player know what score is is as the game is going on.
When either the player or the computer reaches 3 it then stops the game and lets you know if you won or lost and the final score.
